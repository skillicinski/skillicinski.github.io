# Agent Guidelines

Brief notes for AI agents working on this repo.

## Workflow

- Use `gh` CLI for GitHub operations (commits, pushes, repo management)
- Preview changes locally with `hugo server -D` before pushing
- Commit in logical chunks with clear messages

## Cost Awareness

- GitHub Actions minutes are metered - avoid unnecessary pushes that trigger workflows
- Don't provision Codespaces, Packages, or other usage-priced GitHub features without explicit approval
- Batch related changes into single commits when practical

## Security

- Never install packages via pip/npm without verifying the source
- No untrusted dependencies - check package popularity, maintenance status, and known vulnerabilities
- Don't expose secrets, tokens, or personal information in code or config
- Keep the repo public-safe: assume all code is visible to everyone
- Don't modify `.git/` or bypass branch protections

## Hugo/Blowfish Specifics

- Theme is a git submodule at `themes/blowfish/` - don't modify it directly
- Custom overrides go in `layouts/` and `assets/css/custom.css`
- Config lives in `config/_default/`
- Content in `content/` (projects, pages)

## Local Development

- Run `hugo server -D` for live preview
- Site deploys automatically on push to `main` via GitHub Actions
