Me and my team do most things data in our day-to-day – extracting data from third-party tools, running prediction models, engaging end users with visualisations and more. We also build and maintain our own infrastructure in collaboration with product development, focusing on scalability for a data mesh inspired architecture.

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Spark
- **Tools**: dbt, Airflow, Docker, Looker Core
- **Cloud**: AWS (Glue, S3, Athena, Lambda, Batch), GCP (GCS, BigQuery)
