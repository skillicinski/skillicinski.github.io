## Hi, I'm Simon

I'm an Analytics Engineer based in Stockholm, Sweden. I hold a BSc in Media Technology from KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

## What I Do

I build data lakehouses on AWS, focusing on scalable and maintainable data infrastructure. My daily toolkit includes:

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Spark
- **Tools**: dbt, Apache Airflow, Docker
- **Cloud**: AWS (Glue, S3, Athena, Lambda)

## Beyond Code

When I'm not wrangling data, you'll find me doing woodworking projects or out for a run around Stockholm.
